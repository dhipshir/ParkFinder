# ParkFinder
 

A web app created for the final (group) project in EECS 493: User Interface Development Fall 2018. ParkFinder was created to help users find available parking within public parking structures in Ann Arbor. It allows the user to enter their location, then provides all of the public structures along with their addresses, distance from the user, and current number of available spaces. Users can then choose to get directions to a structure via Google Maps API integration. The list of parking structures can be sorted by (nearest) distance or # of available spots.
